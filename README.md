A Geometry Dash Fangame for the Wii


## Controls
Wiimote
* A = jump
* HOME = exit RiiDash

Balance Board (yes I, Cooper, created for no fucking reason then just because i was board as hell and i thought it would be fun)
* Holding Power for 100 frames or more = exits RiiDash on release of Power
* Pressing Power = Change Mode between "jump with you" and "opposite" (the names i just name up!)
    * The "jump with you" mode (default) is when you jump and get your body weight off the balance board equals a jump in game
    * The "opposite" mode is when you put pressure on the balance board and that equals a jump in game
